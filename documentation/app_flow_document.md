# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A brand-new user begins their experience by navigating to the Checky landing page at `https://checky.example.com`. This page introduces the service, highlights its API-driven validation engine, and presents a prominent “Get Started” button. Clicking this button opens a registration form requesting an email address, a password, and an agreement to the terms of service. Upon submitting the form, the user receives an email with an activation link. Following the link confirms the email address and directs the user to a welcome page that prompts them to log in.

For returning users, the landing page offers a “Sign In” link that leads to a login form. Users enter their email and password to access the application. If a user forgets their password, they click a “Forgot Password” link, provide their email address, and receive a reset link. Following that link allows them to set a new password and then return to the login form. After a successful login, the user is taken to the main dashboard. To sign out, the user clicks their profile icon in the header and selects “Sign Out,” which ends the session and returns them to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once signed in, the user lands on the Checky Home page. The header displays the Checky logo, a navigation menu with links for Dashboard, Documentation, API Explorer, Examples, and Account Settings, and a profile icon at the top right. A sidebar on the left mirrors these navigation links for quick access. The central area of the Dashboard shows the user’s API token prominently displayed in a read-only field with a “Copy” button. Below this token, usage statistics appear, showing the number of checks performed today, this week, and this month.

From the Dashboard, the user can click Documentation to view API reference and guides, click API Explorer to experiment with endpoints directly, or click Examples to download sample scripts. Hovering over any navigation link highlights it and updates the central panel title. This layout ensures that all core functionality—retrieving documentation, testing endpoints, and managing tokens—is reachable in one click.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user selects API Explorer from the navigation, the central panel changes to an interactive interface listing available endpoints. By default, `POST /v1/check` is open. The user fills in a JSON payload in the editor that appears and then clicks “Send Request.” The application sends the payload to the backend API and displays the JSON response below the editor. If audio feedback is enabled in Account Settings, the user hears a success or failure tone immediately when the response returns.

To explore status retrieval, the user switches the dropdown to `GET /v1/status/{id}`, enters a previously returned check ID in the path field, and clicks “Send Request.” The panel updates with the latest status JSON. A “Copy cURL” button lets the user copy a command that reproduces the request in a terminal. If the response includes any RAG-enriched explanation text, the user sees expandable sections that reveal detailed context and remediation suggestions.

Clicking Examples in the navigation transitions to a page that lists Python demo scripts for foundational use. Clicking a script name opens a code viewer where the user can review the content, click a “Download” button to save the file locally, or click a “Run Demo” link that launches the script in a cloud shell with the user’s token preconfigured.

Clicking Documentation moves the user to the Sphinx-generated site, complete with a left-hand table of contents and main panel for reStructuredText pages. The user can click any section—such as Authentication, Check Endpoint, or RAG Integration—and read detailed instructions and schemas. A “Back to App” link in the header returns the user to the Checky application Dashboard.

## Settings and Account Management
When the user chooses Account Settings from the header or sidebar, the central panel displays three tabs: Profile, Security, and Token Management. In the Profile tab, the user updates their display name and email. After editing, they click “Save Changes” and see a confirmation banner. The Security tab allows the user to change their password by entering the current password and a new one twice, then clicking “Update Password.” A success message confirms the change.

In Token Management, the user views their active API token and may click “Regenerate Token” to invalidate the old token and generate a new one. The application asks for confirmation via a modal dialog. Once confirmed, the new token appears, accompanied by a “Copy” button. All tabs display a “Return to Dashboard” link at the top, which, when clicked, takes the user back to the main Dashboard.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters incorrect login credentials, an inline error message appears below the password field stating, “Invalid email or password,” and the input fields are highlighted in red. During sign-up, if an email is already registered, a message reads, “This email is in use. Please sign in or reset your password.” When interacting with the API Explorer, if the backend returns a 4xx or 5xx error, the response panel shows the status code, error message, and any error details in JSON. An audio failure tone also plays if enabled.

Network connectivity issues while browsing the application trigger a full-page banner stating, “You appear to be offline. Please check your connection.” The navigation links become disabled until connectivity is restored. If the user attempts to regenerate a token but the API is unreachable, a modal informs them that the action failed and suggests retrying later. All error messages include a link to the Support page where users can submit a ticket.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a new user arrives at the Checky landing page, the journey guides them smoothly through account creation, email verification, and first login. The main Dashboard offers a clear starting point for discovering their API token, reviewing usage statistics, and navigating to examples or documentation. Core features like the API Explorer and example scripts enable rapid integration and testing. Settings and Account Management allow users to maintain their profile, secure their credentials, and control their API token lifecycle. Throughout the experience, clear error handling and support pathways ensure that users can recover from mistakes or connectivity problems. Ultimately, everyday users finish this journey fully equipped to integrate Checky into their workflows, automate checks, and benefit from real-time audio feedback and rich, context-aware explanations.

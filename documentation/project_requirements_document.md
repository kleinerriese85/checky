# Project Requirements Document for "checky"

## 1. Project Overview

**checky** is a lightweight, API-driven service designed to validate or monitor arbitrary inputs, workflows, or data against a set of predefined rules and conditions. By exposing a clear RESTful interface, checky allows developers and automation pipelines to programmatically submit items for verification, receive immediate pass/fail results, and obtain rich, contextual explanations when checks fail. An optional audio feedback layer enriches the user experience by playing alert sounds (e.g., success dings or failure alarms) in real time.

The service is built to solve the problem of integrating robust, customizable validation logic into a wide range of systems—from CI/CD pipelines and monitoring dashboards to desktop utilities—without reimplementing core checking engines. Key success criteria include: 1) seamless API integration that requires minimal boilerplate, 2) accurate, context-aware explanations powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and 3) reliable audio notifications to surface critical events in noisy or distraction-free environments.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope (v1.0)
- RESTful API endpoints to submit items for validation and retrieve structured results.
- Rule-based engine core where administrators define checks via configuration files or code modules.
- Audio feedback module that plays configurable `.wav` or `.mp3` alert sounds on check success or failure.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) component using a local corpus (`rag-content.txt`) to enrich failure explanations.
- Sphinx-generated, Read the Docs–hosted documentation covering API reference, configuration guide, and example scripts.
- Example scripts in Python demonstrating basic API usage and audio integration.
- Makefile tasks for building docs (`make docs`), running tests, and packaging the service.

### Out-of-Scope (Phase 2+)
- Web-based graphical dashboard for rule management and real-time event viewing.
- Multi-tenant or RBAC (role-based access control) features beyond simple API tokens.
- Fully managed cloud hosting or turnkey SaaS deployment.
- Mobile or desktop client applications (provided examples are CLI-only).
- Dynamic knowledge base updates for RAG content (manual file updates only in v1).

## 3. User Flow

A typical user is a developer or DevOps engineer who wants to integrate checky into their automation pipeline. They start by signing up for an API token via a CLI or web form. This token is stored as an environment variable or config entry. Next, they consult the Sphinx-generated docs to learn which endpoints to call and how to format their JSON payload. In a script or application, they send an HTTPS POST to `/v1/check` with the data to validate.

Upon receiving a request, checky runs the data through its rule engine, queries the RAG corpus for context, and assembles a JSON response that includes pass/fail status, a detailed explanation, and optional remediation tips. If audio feedback is enabled and the environment supports it, checky plays a success or failure sound. Finally, the developer’s script can parse the JSON, log the results, trigger alerts, or gate further steps in the workflow based on the output.

## 4. Core Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Simple API token header for all endpoints.
- **Rule-Based Validation Engine**: Configurable rules or plugins to define pass/fail logic.
- **RESTful API**: Endpoints for submitting checks (`POST /v1/check`) and retrieving status (`GET /v1/status/{id}`).
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Local text corpus lookup to enrich explanations.
- **Audio Feedback Module**: Plays `.wav` or `.mp3` alerts upon success or failure.
- **Sphinx Documentation**: Auto-generated API reference and guides.
- **Example Scripts**: Python examples demonstrating API usage and audio alerts.
- **Build Automation**: Makefile targets for docs, tests, and packaging.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Language & API Framework**: Python 3.10+ with FastAPI (or Flask) for REST endpoints.
- **RAG Library**: A simple retrieval tool (e.g., RAKE or Whoosh) with optional OpenAI API integration for GPT-based text enrichment.
- **Audio Playback**: Python’s `playsound` or `pygame` module to trigger local audio files.
- **Documentation**: Sphinx with `recommonmark` or `MyST` for Markdown support, published via Read the Docs.
- **Build & CI**: Makefile for local automation, GitHub Actions for CI (lint, test, build docs).
- **Testing**: Pytest for unit and integration tests.
- **Packaging**: setuptools or Poetry to manage dependencies and distribution.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: API response time under 200ms for basic checks; under 500ms when RAG lookup is involved.
- **Scalability**: Able to handle 100 requests per second on a single modest server instance.
- **Security**: HTTPS enforcement, API token validation, input sanitization to prevent injection.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target; retries on transient RAG or I/O failures.
- **Usability**: Clear, example-driven documentation; consistent JSON schemas; descriptive error messages.
- **Maintainability**: Modular code structure; automated tests covering at least 80% of code paths.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- **Python Ecosystem**: Assumes Python 3.10+ environment with access to PyPI packages.
- **Local RAG Corpus**: RAG content is stored in a flat text file (`rag-content.txt`) and must be updated manually.
- **Audio Environment**: Host system must support local audio playback; headless servers may skip audio.
- **No External DB**: v1 runs in memory or with minimal file-based storage (no relational database required).
- **GPT or LLM Access**: Optional GPT calls assume valid OpenAI API key and network access.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **API Rate Limits**: Public API host may throttle at 60 requests/minute; implement client-side backoff.
- **Large RAG File**: Very large `rag-content.txt` can slow lookups; consider indexing or chunking.
- **Audio Playback Failures**: In headless or Dockerized environments, audio calls may hang; detect and fallback gracefully.
- **Documentation Drift**: Without CI checks, docs can become outdated; enforce automated doc builds and link checks.
- **Error Handling Ambiguity**: Custom rule errors need clear mapping to HTTP status codes; define a consistent error schema.
